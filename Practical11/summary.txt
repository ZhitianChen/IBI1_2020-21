Identical amino acids percentage:
Mouse-Human: 89.64%
Mouse-Random sequence: 5.86%
Human-Random sequence: 5.41%

Alignment score:
Mouse-Human: 1091
Mouse-Random sequence: -250
Human-Random sequence: -250

Interpretation:
The identical amino acids percentage and the alignment score between human and mouse are relatively high, which indicates that it is reasonable to use mouse for experiments.
This also shows the relatively close relationship between mouse and human in the protein, which can be another evidence for the theory of evolution.
