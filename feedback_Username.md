Practical 4
It seems everythins was good.
Practical 5
I rewrote some code and correct some syntax errors, such as inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation. I also added parenthesis when I used 'print'.
I ran the mysterycode.py one more time and find the correct function. I changed my description about that.
I also corrected my code in r_rate.py, I found that I calculate one time more than needed.
Practical 6
I found that I forgot to display the frequency of the data and I add code to display that.
In the pie chart I forgot to give it a title and I use plt.title('') to achieve that.
I also forgot to display the list of average exon lengths and I add code to display that.
